I use this tool to create backdrops for my Windows machine and I used it to make sprite sheets for Cool Herders.

Unfortunately, it's probably not useful to anyone. I used the now obsolete ImgSource library from Smaller Animals, and beyond that I hacked it up with Unicode support for this tool, so without that, which I can't give you, you can't build this. (You can still run the bin in the dist folder though).

It would be possible to replace the functions used here with generics, it's just more effort than I have interest in right now.
